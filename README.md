## Usage

Follow these simple steps to interact with the bot:

1. **Add the bot to your contact list.**

   After the bot has been added, begin your interaction by sending your questions, commands or comments.

2. **Send commands.**

   You can use the following commands to communicate with the bot:

   - **Generate an Image:** `!image [text]` - This command creates an image based on the provided text.
   - **Reset User History:** `!reset [text]` - This command resets the user's command history. If text is provided following the reset command, the bot will generate a GPT-based response based on this text.
   - **Send a Text Message:** `[text]` - Send any text to the bot and it will generate a GPT-based response relevant to your text.

3. **Identify error responses.**

   If there are any errors in processing your requests or commands, the bot will respond with a ‚ùå reaction.
